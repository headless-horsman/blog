Hi :) My name is Nicholas Horsman; I work as a full-time software developer.

My current experience is mostly with C#, C++, and legacy FORTRAN and VisualBasic.

This blog is intended to document my journey in learning more about topics I'm interested in.

| Topics |
|:-------:|
| Compilers |
| Programming Language Design |
| Operating Systems |

Along the way, I'll probably sprinkle in a few special interests of mine, like linguistics and etymology.
Unfortunately, this will *also* probably involve learning more aboutâ€¦<font size=1>front-end</font> _\*\*shudders\*\*_.

I can be contacted at my e-mail: [nicholas@headless-horsman.com](mailto:nicholas@headless-horsman.com),
and future experiments will live on my [GitHub](https://github.com/headless-horsman).
