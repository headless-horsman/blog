I tend to be the type of person who _consumes_ content rather than creating it.
But recently, I've gotten inspired to start making my own content in a dedicated space.

Most of these posts are going to take the form of tutorials, walking you through something.
I figured there's no better place to start than **here**.

# So you want to start a blog
There's a lot of different options to get you started.
You've got the big ones: Wordpress, WIX, Blogger, Medium, etc.
As someone who's never worked on any of those platforms, I **obviously** have the authority
to make sweeping generalizations about them.

Personally, they all just felt too blasé. I wanted something that that felt more *personal*.
After next to no research, I arbitrarily decided on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
And here we are.

## Starting the Site
Hugo makes it incredibly easy to get your site up and running. On their [getting started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
page, they go over how to make your first post.

Truthfully, all of the customization they offer can be a little overwhelming, so it's best to start off simple.
Just choose a theme, and dive right in!

## The Host of Christmas Past
Once you come up with some content for your site, you're going to need some place to host it.
Again, the Hugo docs [come in handy](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/).
One that stuck out to me immediately was [Render](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-render/), mainly because

> Static sites are **completely** free on Render…

Hey, that's pretty neat! That means if all your doing is hosting a simple blog (like this), you don't have
to worry about any additional costs.

Render also offers
* Automatic site updates when pushes are made to a branch
* Site previews on GitHub pull requests
* Custom domain support

These are all pluses in my book!

If you put all of this together, you're left with… well… this!
A site hosted completely for free and a snazzy looking blog.
